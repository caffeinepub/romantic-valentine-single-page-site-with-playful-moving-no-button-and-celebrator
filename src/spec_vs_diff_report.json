  "summary": "Most interactive Valentine single-page UI elements are implemented (centered prompt, evasive “No” button movement with scaling “Yes”, animated hearts background, success dialog with confetti, and a play/pause music control). However, the required generated image assets are not present/used, the success message is not an exact text match, and the success UI does not clearly meet the “full-screen modal/section” requirement based on the diff.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "On “Yes 💖” click, show a full-screen modal or full-screen success section with smooth fade/zoom transition containing the exact romantic message (exact text and line breaks).",
      "reason": "The dialog content is styled as a centered max-width dialog (not clearly full-screen), and the message text differs from the required exact wording/punctuation (straight apostrophes instead of curly; text split into paragraphs with different punctuation).",

      "reason": "No files under frontend/public/assets/generated are shown as added, and the background/confetti are drawn procedurally on canvas rather than referencing the required image assets.",
